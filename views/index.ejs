        <h2>About the Creator</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Carla Pacheco, the creator of Sensi Tracker. I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease and have been navigating its symptoms through lifestyle adjustments. This includes avoiding foods that irritate the body and cause inflammation and discomfort. I understand the frustration of keeping track of foods and how difficult it can be to cross-reference allergens, reactions, and food groups.</p>
